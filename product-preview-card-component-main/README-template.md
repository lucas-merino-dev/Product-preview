## Overview

  This is my second challenge completed and my first one created without using help from other solutions! Really proud of this one!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (kinda messy though)
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

  This project helped me to fix some trouble I had in the past with using some elements, like @media and images!
  I'm really proud of myself for being able to change images based on screen sizes. :D

### Useful resources

  Stack Overflow all the way!
